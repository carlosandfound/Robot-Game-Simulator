/**
 *  @brief An application that uses the libSimpleGraphics library to open up
 *  a window that includes a few buttons for controlling the simulation and can
 *  be used to draw circles and other computer graphics.
 *
 *  After constructing a new GraphicsArenaViewer, call Run to start and run the
 *  application. Run will not return until the application window is closed.
 *  Make sure that you call cs3081::InitGraphics before creating the
 *  GraphicsArenaViewer app.  Example:
 *
 *  ```
 *  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
 *      cs3081::InitGraphics();
 *      RobotViewer *app = new RobotViewer();
 *      app->Run();
 *      cs3081::ShutdownGraphics();
 *      return 0;
 *  }
 *  ```
 *
 *  While the window is open UpdateSimulation will be called repeatedly,
 *  once per frame. Fill this in to update your simulation or perform any other
 *  processing that should happen over time as the simulation progresses.
 *
 *  Fill in the `On*()` methods as desired to respond to user input events.
 *
 *  Fill in the `Draw*()` methods to draw graphics on the screen using
 *  either the `nanovg` library or raw `OpenGL`.
